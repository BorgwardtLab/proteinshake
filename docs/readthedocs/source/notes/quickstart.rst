Quickstart
==========

ProteinShake enables you to load a variety of protein structure datasets and convert them to one of three representations (point clouds, voxel grids, and graphs).
The datasets can be loaded into any of the common deep learning frameworks.
Built on the datasets, we provide evaluation tasks, which provide data splits and metrics.
