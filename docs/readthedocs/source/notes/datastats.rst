About the Data
==================

Our datasets are built from the following protein structure databases:

* `RCSB <https://www.rcsb.org/>`_: central repository for all solved 3D structures (contains Gene Ontology, Enzyme Classification, Protein Family annotations, etc.). 
* `PDBBind <http://www.pdbbind.org.cn/index.php/>`_: curated dataset of biomolecular complexes (protein-protein, protein-small molecule, etc.) including experimental affinity information. 
* `AlphaFold <https://www.deepmind.com/open-source/alphafold-protein-structure-database>`_: database of predicted protein 3D structures. 
* `DUDE-Z <https://dudez.docking.org>`_: benchmark of protein targets with active and decoy ligand sets. 

All the datasets we built from these sources are hosted on `Zenodo <https://sandbox.zenodo.org/record/1170307>`_.
