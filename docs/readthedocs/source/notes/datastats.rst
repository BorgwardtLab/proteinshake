About the Data
==================

We currently collect structures from the following databases:

* `RCSB <https://www.rcsb.org/>`_: central repository for all solved 3D structures (contains Gene Ontology, Enzyme Classification, Protein Family annotations, etc.). 
* `TMAlign <https://zhanggroup.org/TM-align/>`_: curated benchmark dataset for protein-protein simlarity computations. 
* `PDBBind <http://www.pdbbind.org.cn/index.php/>`_: curated dataset of biomolecular complexes (protein-protein, protein-small molecule, etc.) including experimental affinity information. 
* `AlphaFold <https://www.deepmind.com/open-source/alphafold-protein-structure-database>`_: database of predicted protein 3D structures.
