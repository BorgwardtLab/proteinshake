Leaderboard Submission
======================

If you would like to publish your results on the ProteinShake tasks you can open a pull request in the `GitHub repository <https://github.com/BorgwardtLab/proteinshake>`_.

Please add your results to the corresponding JSON file in the :code:`leaderboard` folder, following the template of other submissions. Results should be provided to the third decimal, preferrably on all data splits.

Since we cannot review all submissions in detail ourselves, we will only accept submissions that have been reviewed before in a journal or conference. Please provide the link to the accepted paper. We strongly prefer if the code reproducing your results is also linked.
