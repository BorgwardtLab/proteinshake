`sup_enzyme_commision_with_gnn.ipynb` helps you get started with using the graph representations of protein 3D structures provided by ProteinShake. This [notebook](sup_enzyme_commission_with_gnn.ipynb) shows how to train a GNN using the graph representations. You can also run the tutorial in a [colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/BorgwardtLab/proteinshake/blob/main/examples/sup_enzyme_commission_with_gnn.ipynb)
